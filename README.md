## 1. Introduction

Scala Forex is a high-performance Scala library for performing exchange rate lookups and currency conversions, using [Joda-Money][joda-money] and [Joda-Time][joda-time].

It includes configurable LRU (Least Recently Used) caches to minimize calls to the API; this makes the library usable in high-volume environments such as Hadoop and Storm.

Currently Scala Forex uses the [Open Exchange Rates API][oer-signup] to perform currency lookups.

## 2. Setup

### 2.1 OER Sign Up

First [sign up][oer-signup] to Open Exchange Rates to get your App ID for API access.

There are three types of accounts supported by OER API, Unlimited, Enterprise and Developer levels. See the [sign up][oer-signup] page for specific account descriptions. For Scala Forex, we recommend an Enterprise or Unlimited account, unless all of your conversions are to or from USD (see section 4.5 OER accounts for an explanation). For 10-minute rate updates, you will need an Unlimited account (other accounts are hourly).

### 2.2 Installation

The latest version of Scala Forex is 0.5.0, which is cross-built against 2.10.x and 2.11.x.

If you're using SBT, add the following lines to your build file:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "com.snowplowanalytics" %% "scala-forex" % "0.5.0"
)
```

Note the double percent (`%%`) between the group and artifactId. That'll ensure you get the right package for your Scala version.

## 3. Usage

The Scala Forex supports two types of usage:

1. Exchange rate lookups
2. Currency conversions

Both usage types support live, near-live or historical (end-of-day) exchange rates.

### 3.1 Configuration

Scala Forex is configured via two case classes:

1. `ForexConfig` contains general configuration
2. `OerClientConfig` contains Open Exchange Rates-specific configuration

#### 3.1.1 ForexConfig

Case class with defaults:

```scala
case class ForexConfig(
  nowishCacheSize: Int       = 13530,
  nowishSecs: Int            = 300,  
  eodCacheSize: Int          = 405900,  
  getNearestDay: EodRounding = EodRoundDown,
  baseCurrency: String       = "USD"  
)
```

To go through each in turn:

1. `nowishCacheSize` is the size configuration for near-live(nowish) lookup cache, it can be disabled by setting its value to 0. The key to nowish cache is a currency pair so the size of the cache equals to the number of pairs of currencies available.

2. `nowishSecs` is the time configuration for near-live lookup. Nowish call will use the exchange rates stored in nowish cache if its time stamp is less than or equal to `nowishSecs` old.

3. `eodCacheSize` is the size configuration for end-of-day(eod) lookup cache, it can be disabled by setting its value to 0. The key to eod cache is a tuple of currency pair and time stamp, so the size of eod cache equals to the number of currency pairs times the days which the cache will remember the data for.

4. `getNearestDay` is the rounding configuration for latest eod(at) lookup. The lookup will be performed on the next day if the rounding mode is set to EodRoundUp, and on the previous day if EodRoundDown.

5. `baseCurrency` can be configured to different currencies by the users.

For an explanation for the default values please see section **4.4 Explanation of defaults** below.

#### 3.1.2 OerClientConfig

Case class with defaults:

```scala
case class OerClientConfig(
  appId: String,            
  accountLevel: AccountType
)
```

To go through each in turn:

1. `appId` is the unique key for the user's account
2. `accountLevel` is the account type provided by the user which should obviously be consistent with the app ID.
There are three types of account levels, users should provide the exact account type name to configure the OER Client:
  1. UnlimitedAccount
  2. EnterpriseAccount
  3. DeveloperAccount

### 3.2 Rate lookup

For the required imports, please see section **4.2 REPL setup** below.

val priceInEuros = fx.convert(9.99, "GBP").to("EUR").nowish
```

#### 3.3.3 Near-live rate without cache

Note that this will be a live rate conversion if cache is not available.
Conversion using a live exchange rate with 500 seconds nowishSecs,
this conversion will be done via HTTP request:

```scala

// 9.99 GBP => EUR
val fx = Forex(ForexConfig(nowishSecs = 500, nowishCacheSize = 0), OerClientConfig(appId, DeveloperAccount))
val priceInEuros = fx.convert(9.99, "GBP").to("EUR").nowish

val tradeInYen = fx.convert(10000).to("JPY").eod(eodDate)
```

### 3.4 Usage notes

#### 3.4.1 LRU cache

The `lruCache` value determines the maximum number of values to keep in the LRU cache, which the Client will check prior to making an API lookup. To disable the LRU cache, set its size to zero, i.e. `lruCache = 0`.

#### 3.4.2 From currency selection

A default _"from currency"_ can be specified for all operations, using the `baseCurrency` argument to the `ForexConfig` object.
If not specified, `baseCurrency` is set to USD by default.

## 4. Development

### 4.1 REPL setup

To try out Scala Forex in the Scala REPL:

```
guest> sbt console
...
scala> val appId = "<<key>>"
scala> import com.snowplowanalytics.forex.{Forex, ForexConfig}
scala> import com.snowplowanalytics.forex.oerclient.{OerClientConfig, DeveloperAccount}  
scala> val fx = Forex(ForexConfig(), OerClientConfig(appId, DeveloperAccount))
scala> val usd2jpy = fx.rate.to("JPY").now
```

### 4.2 Running tests

You **must** export your `OER_KEY` or else the test suite will fail. To run the test suite locally:

```
$ export OER_KEY=<<key>>
$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/scala-forex.git
$ cd scala-forex
$ sbt test
```

## 5. Implementation details

### 5.1 End-of-day definition

The end of today is 00:00 on the next day.

### 5.2 Exchange rate lookup

When `.now` is specified, the **live** exchange rate available from Open Exchange Rates is used.

When `.nowish` is specified, a **cached** version of the **live** exchange rate is used, if the timestamp of that exchange rate is less than or equal to `nowishSecs` (see above) ago. Otherwise a new lookup is performed.

When `.at(...)` is specified, the **latest end-of-day rate prior** to the datetime is used by default. Or users can configure that Scala Forex "round up" to the end of the occurring day.

When `.eod(...)` is specified, the end-of-day rate for the **specified day** is used. Any hour/minute/second/etc portion of the datetime is ignored.

### 5.3 LRU cache

We recommend trying different LRU cache sizes to see what works best for you.

Please note that the LRU cache implementation is **not** thread-safe ([see this note][twitter-lru-cache]). Switch it off if you are working with threads.

### 5.4 Explanation of defaults

#### 5.4.1 `nowishCache` = (165 * 164 / 2) = 13530

There are 165 currencies provided by the OER API, hence 165 * 164 pairs of currency combinations.
The key in nowish cache is a tuple of source currency and target currency, and the nowish cache was implemented in a way such that a lookup from CurrencyA to CurrencyB or from CurrencyB to CurrencyA will use the same exchange rate, so we don't need to store both in the caches. Hence there are (165 * 164 / 2) pairs of currencies for nowish cache.

#### 5.4.2 `eodCache` = (165 * 164 / 2) * 30 = 405900

Assume the eod cache stores the rates to each pair of currencies for 1 month(i.e. 30 days).
There are 165 * 164 / 2 pairs of currencies, hence (165 * 164 / 2) * 30 entries.

#### 5.4.3 `nowishSecs` = 300

Assume nowish cache stores data for 5 mins.

#### 5.4.4 `getNearestDay` = EodRoundDown

By convention, we are always interested in the exchange rates prior to the query date, hence EodRoundDown.

#### 5.4.5 `baseCurrency` = USD

We selected USD for the base currency because this is the OER default as well.

### 5.5 OER accounts

With Open Exchange Rates' Unlimited and Enterprise accounts, Scala Forex can specify the base currency to use when looking up exchange rates; Developer-level accounts will always retrieve rates against USD, so a rate lookup from e.g. GBY to EUR will require two conversions (GBY -> USD -> EUR). For this reason, we recommend Unlimited and Enterprise-level accounts for slightly more accurate non-USD-related lookups.
