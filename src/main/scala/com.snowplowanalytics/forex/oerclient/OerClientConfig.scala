 * There are three types of accounts supported by OER API.
 * For scala-forex library, the main difference between Unlimited/Enterprise
 * and Developer users is that users with Unlimited/Enterprise accounts
 * can use the base currency for API requests, but this library will provide
 * automatic conversions between OER default base currencies(USD)
 * and user-defined base currencies. However this will increase calls to the API
 * and will slow down the performance.
